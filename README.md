A Flutter Application for Leasing or Renting Advertisements

# What's the idea?
In the most countries of the world rent or lease has become the trend. People have realized that it is more profitable to rent something you use once or twice than to buy it. Previously, this was only about apartments and cars, but now almost everything is rentable.

Regularly, when a person wants to rent a product, he must follow the traditional way which is by searching and asking the people for the product on range neighborhood, region, and the local city. He may also browse and search on social media, and after founding the certain product, he and the product owner arrange a meeting for negotiating on the price and the details of the product, and if each one agreed they made a rental contract, this traditional way is exhausting and takes time and money on searching, previewing, and negotiate. Sometimes the lessors don't have the ways to offer their products for rent, so the tenant has to look for them personally.

With the advent of web and mobile technology, many of websites and mobile applications were developed to provide the rental services online. Therefore, in this project a mobile application is designed for helping the tenant to search for the products to rent and the lessor to offer products for rent in an easy and simple way.

The application use focuses only in the Republic of Yemen, which is covers all governorates, regions, and cities of Yemen, and it also includes specific product categories and roles that directly via admin to prevent any post that may be against the policy use of the application.

The application will be on mobile phones which are developed using the Android-based platform, this application can benefit to rent all things between tenants and be supervised by a supervisor. Rental application mechanisms are entered into the application as a user that have to register and account, but if you want to make a rent post or request post, it is necessary to register an account in the application with all required information, and the Communication between the tenant and the lessor is done via the phone number or WhatsApp.
